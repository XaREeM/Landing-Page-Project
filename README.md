## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

Description:
This is a Landing Page DOM Manipulation Project. With ready HTML and CSS files that needs manipulation.
What i've learned throughout this course is
1) How to appendChild into a document fragment.
2) creating li elements and nesting them inside ul without the need to edit through HTML, did this only
   using DOM Manipulation.
3) learned about the anchor tag and how to use # symbol with it as well as implement an onclick inside it.
4) also learned about the IntersectionObserver that is more of the screen's eyes for my browser window, checking
   whether it has reached a specific part or not and then provide information in DevTools that this part is active.
5) preventing defualt action of something and forcing it into another action (scrolling into view), and making
   scrolling smooth.
6) adding an event listner to scrolling that shows and hides navigation bar on scrolling.
